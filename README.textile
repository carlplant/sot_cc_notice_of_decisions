What is a Key Decision?
 
A key decision means an executive decision which is likely:-
to result in the authority incurring expenditure which is, or the making of savings which are, significant, having regard to the local authority's budget for the services or function to which the decision relates. The Stoke-on-Trent City Council constitution states that savings are deemed to be significant if they exceed Â£500,000; and/or to be significant in terms of its effects on communities living or working in an area comprising two or more wards or electoral divisions in the area of the local authority.
